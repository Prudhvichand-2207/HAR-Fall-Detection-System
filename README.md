# Human Activity Recognition & Fall Detection System

This project implements a complete **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** and **Fall Detection System** using:
- Traditional Machine Learning Models
- Deep Learning Models (CNN, LSTM, PCNN-Transformer)
- Signal Processing & Windowing Techniques

It is designed for **wearable sensor-based fall detection** using the SisFall dataset.
